Chapters 5-through-7 are all basic debugging, error handling, and program structure topics that are generalizable to many other languages. I already know them (and use them daily) from my work as a Data Scientist using Python, so they aren't a productive use of my time. I read them to review the basics, but writing the code is unnecessary for me. Instead, I've skipped straight to Chapter 8.
